        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last updated: 9.8.2025</p>

        <p>Alembic (“the App”) is designed to help you save quotes and highlights from anything you read, watch, or listen to — while keeping your data private. This policy explains how your information is handled when you use the App.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>Alembic does not collect any personal information directly.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Your highlights and quotes</strong> are stored either:
                <ul>
                    <li>Locally on your device, or</li>
                    <li>In your personal iCloud account (if enabled in iOS settings).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Crash reports & diagnostics</strong> may be collected by Apple automatically if you have opted in to share them with developers in your iOS settings. This data is anonymized and sent to Apple, not directly to Alembic.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How Your Information Is Used</h2>
        <p>Your highlights are stored solely so that you can access them later — either locally or via iCloud sync between your devices. We do not use your data for analytics, marketing, or advertising.</p>

        <h2>3. Sharing of Information</h2>
        <p>We do not share your data with any third parties, except as necessary to provide storage via <strong>Apple iCloud</strong>, which is governed by Apple’s privacy policy:  
            <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/</a>
        </p>

        <h2>4. Data Storage & Security</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Local data remains on your device and under your control.</li>
            <li>iCloud data is encrypted by Apple in transit and at rest. Alembic does not have access to your iCloud content.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Your Choices</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>You can disable iCloud for Alembic in your iOS settings, in which case your data stays only on your device.</li>
            <li>You can delete iCloud data for Alembic at any time via your Apple ID account settings.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>Alembic is not specifically directed toward children, but it is safe for all ages. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under 13 (or under the age required by local laws).</p>

        <h2>7. International Users</h2>
        <p>If you are located in the EU, UK, California, or other regions with data protection laws, please note: Alembic does not collect or process your personal data directly. All storage is handled by Apple’s iCloud service under their terms and privacy policy.</p>
